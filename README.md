## Prerequisites

- while it is not required basic familiarity with Unix command-line tools can be extremly useful. If names like [`grep`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), [`sed`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) or [`wc`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_%28Unix%29) doesn't mean anything to you it is a good idea to change that.

## Development environment

- keep your development environment as close as it is possible to the target platform. At this point shinyapps.io is using [Ubuntu 12.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin) with `en_US.UTF-8` locale. You can create similar environment using tools like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/).

## Languages and libraries

## Common problems and troubleshooting

- if you don't know where to start or you are stuck be sure to check fora. To quote [@LaurentFranckx](https://github.com/LaurentFranckx) _they can make the difference between passing and failing_.
- if you ask a question regarding issues with your code, it is wise to provide the [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) and all the additional information which can be useful (error messages, warnings, `sessionInfo`) to diagnose the problem. Describing [what have you tried](whathaveyoutried.com) is always welcome.
